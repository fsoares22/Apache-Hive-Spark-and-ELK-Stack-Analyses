# Hive-Spark-Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logstash
3 Assignments done for one of my courses. 
Project 3 was just a screenshot of a working connection to Kibana which is why it has been omitted.

Project 1 was done using Hive to clean and analyze data about used cars, Project 2 was done with Spark (using the same data), and Project 4 was the Elasticsearch/Kibana/Logstash assignment analyzing 311 calls in New York.

Project 2 is better than Project 1. It was my first time using Apache and instructions for the assignment were unclear. I also made better conclusions/recommendations in Project 2 so I believe it is important to include both to demonstrate the progression over just 2-3 weeks.

All of these assignments were done using Google Cloud Platform.

Enjoy!
